Interactive, `.gitignore`-aware workspace cleaner for ResQ development. Provides a TUI that scans for build artifacts and gitignored files, lets you select what to remove, and reclaims disk space safely.

## Overview

`resq-clean` walks the repository tree, applies `.gitignore` rules via the `ignore` crate (supporting negated patterns and nested `.gitignore` files), and presents every gitignored entry in an interactive list sorted by size. You can toggle individual items on or off before confirming deletion.

## Installation

```bash
# From the workspace root
cargo build --release -p resq-clean

# Binary location
target/release/resq-clean
```

## CLI Arguments

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | `false` | Preview what would be deleted without removing anything. Pressing `Enter` in the TUI exits instead of deleting. |

## Usage Examples

### Interactive TUI (default)

```bash
# Launch the cleanup TUI in the current directory
resq-clean
```

The TUI displays all gitignored files and directories sorted by size, with checkboxes. All items are selected by default.

### Dry Run

```bash
# Preview mode -- nothing is deleted
resq-clean --dry-run
```

In dry-run mode, pressing `Enter` exits the TUI without performing any deletions, letting you inspect what would be removed.

### Targeted Cleanup

```bash
# Run from a specific subdirectory
cd services/infrastructure-api && resq-clean
```

The scanner uses the current working directory as its root, so you can scope cleanup to a single service or library.

## TUI Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `q` / `Esc` | Quit without deleting |
| `Space` | Toggle selection on the highlighted item |
| `Enter` | Delete all selected items (or exit in `--dry-run` mode) |
| `Up` / `k` | Move selection up |
| `Down` / `j` | Move selection down |

## What Gets Deleted

Anything matched by `.gitignore` rules, which typically includes:

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `target/` | Rust build output |
| `node_modules/` | npm/bun dependencies |
| `.next/` | Next.js build cache |
| `dist/` | TypeScript/Bun build output |
| `build/` | CMake build directories |
| `__pycache__/` | Python bytecode cache |
| `*.pyc` | Compiled Python files |
| `.pytest_cache/` | Pytest cache |
| `*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so` | C/C++ object files and libraries |
| `*.nettrace` | .NET profiling traces |
| `flamegraph.svg` | Generated flame graph profiles |

Files matching negated gitignore entries (e.g., `!dist/keep-this.json`) are preserved automatically.

## Environment Variables

No environment variables are required. The tool operates entirely on the local filesystem using the current working directory as its root.

## Output Format

The TUI header displays the total size of all currently selected items (e.g., `PENDING: 2.4 GB`). Each entry in the list shows:

```
[x] <icon> <relative-path>                      <size>
```

- `[x]` / `[ ]` -- selection checkbox
- Icon -- folder or file indicator
- Relative path -- path relative to the scan root
- Size -- human-readable size (B, KB, MB, GB)

After deletion, the workspace is re-scanned and the list refreshes to reflect the current state.

## Safety Notes

- **Dry-run first**: Always use `--dry-run` on the first pass to review what will be removed.
- **Gitignore-only**: Only files and directories matched by `.gitignore` rules are candidates for deletion. Tracked files are never touched.
- **Negated patterns respected**: Entries matching negated patterns (e.g., `!important.log`) are excluded from the scan.
- **No .git deletion**: The `.git` directory and its contents are unconditionally skipped.
- **Interactive confirmation**: Nothing is deleted until you press `Enter` in the TUI. You can deselect individual items with `Space` before confirming.
- **Re-scan after deletion**: After deleting, the tool re-scans to show the updated state, so you can verify the results.
- **Directories removed recursively**: Selected directories are removed with `remove_dir_all`. Ensure you have deselected anything you want to keep.

## When to Use

- Before committing, to ensure no build artifacts slip through
- After switching branches, to avoid stale build caches
- Periodic deep clean when disk space is low

For ecosystem-specific cleanup without the TUI:

```bash
cargo clean                                              # Rust only
rm -rf services/coordination-hce/node_modules            # Node only
find . -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -rf {} +       # Python only
```
